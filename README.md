ChatGPT
In Cloudinary, the resource_type option specifies the type of file being uploaded. Setting options.resource_type = "auto" allows Cloudinary to automatically detect and handle different types of files, such as images, videos, or raw files.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the different resource_type values:

resource_type: "image": This explicitly specifies that the file being uploaded is an image.
resource_type: "video": This specifies that the file is a video.
resource_type: "raw": This is used for other file types that are not images or videos, such as text files, PDFs, etc.
resource_type: "auto": This allows Cloudinary to automatically detect the file type and handle it accordingly.
